                    specific checklists for all included Microsoft
                    Flight Simulator aircraft. The 80+ page document
                    provides you with everything you need to know
                    to get your aircraft from a cold & dark state to the
                    skies and then back to the ground again before
                    shutting down.</p>
                <p>
                    All default aircraft are included in Aircraft Checklist
                    Pro, including the newly added 40th Anniversary
                    Edition planes and helicopters.

                    Our custom-made application will allow you
                    to access the checklist directly from within the
                    simulator itself. Find the aircraft you’re flying and
                    follow the tried and tested checklists just as real-
                    world pilots would do. You will also have access
                    to the PDF document, which can be saved to any
                    device of your choice.
